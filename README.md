# Two-Doo-List

omg this project made me realize how bad i was at programming an app made of asynchronous functions. 

#1 Order of operations is veryyy important. It's important to understand the timing and execution flow of your code.

#2 Storing values in variable in asynchronous operations to reuse the content that was created at the time.

#3 Need to get better at usin arrays and objects.

#4 For the love of God learn how to organize and separate your code in modules.

#5 Naming variables accurately is super important. Not just variables, modules , files etc is also very important.

#6 Understand the differences of using let and const.

#7 Giving functions parameters is very important for reusability. Gotta understand the concept. Functions can be very powerful. (getPriority for example)

#8 From now on, when building a project, focus on functionality and minimal styling, extensive styling should be left for last.

#9 When you retrieve data from local storage, if you want that data to be on the page on page reload you need to display the data again from the storage and all manipulation related to it?? Also, that data is now separate ? kinda.

#10 Display none to display flex mechanic.

#11 everytime a value gets modified , it needs to be saved in storage. sorta.

#12 console logging to debug is very useful.

#13 using position relative and position absolute to position stuff like buttons inside a form in a specifi way.

#14 Use root psedoelement and set a color pallette for reusability.

#15 When selecting dom nodes, timing and context of selection is important.

#16 CSS can use a lot of improvement.

#17 Need to get better at using array and objects manipulation methods.

#18 === strict equal operator,  = assignment operator

#19 Checking if a variable or value exists before executing a function or something of that nature is sometimes important.
